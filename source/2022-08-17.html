<h1 class="print"> Diehard 'Taiwan independence' separatists to be sanctioned: mainland </h1>
<hr>
<a class="no-print" href=" https://news.cgtn.com/news/2022-08-16/Diehard-Taiwan-independence-separatists-to-be-sanctioned-1cxpUzsi3rq/index.html "> 原文链接 </a> 


<p>A spokesperson of the Taiwan Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee on Tuesday announced sanctions on "Taiwan independence" diehards on a Chinese mainland's list.</p> 

<p>In order to safeguard the peaceful development of the cross-strait relations and the immediate interests of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, and resolutely punish "Taiwan independence" diehard elements, it is decided that Bi-khim Hsiao, Koo Li-hsiung, Tsai Chi-chang, Ker Chien-ming, Lin Fei-fan, Chen Jiau-hua and Wang Ting-yu are listed as diehard "Taiwan independence" separatists, and punitive measures are imposed on them, as well as Su Tseng-chang, You Si-kun and Jaushieh Joseph Wu, who had already been on the list, said the spokesperson.</p> 

<p>They and their family members are banned from entering the mainland and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macao. Their affiliated institutions are restricted from forging cooperation with relevant organizations and individuals on the mainland. The enterprises related to them, as well as their sponsors, are prohibited from engaging in profit-making activities on the mainland. Other punitive measures will also be taken. They will be held to lifelong accountability according to law, said the spokesperson. <br/><br/>Sanctions are also imposed on the president of the "Taiwan Foundation for Democracy," and the secretary general of the "International Cooperation and Development Fund." They are banned from entering the mainland, and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macao, said the spokesperson. You Si-kun is the chairman of the "Taiwan Foundation for Democracy." Jaushieh Joseph Wu is the chairman of the "International Cooperation and Development Fund." <br/><br/>Actions seeking "Taiwan independence" constitute the biggest obstacle to China's reunification and a grave danger to the national rejuvenation. For some time, a few diehard separatist elements, out of their own interests, have gone to their lengths to collude with external forces in provocations advocating "Taiwan independence." They have deliberately instigated confrontations across the Taiwan Straits, and recklessly undermined peace and stability in the region. Their activities became all the more egregious during the visit by Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi to China's Taiwan region, further exposing their obstinate nature in seeking "Taiwan independence," the spokesperson said. <br/><br/>The Chinese mainland will never tolerate any kind of activity to split the country, will never allow any external force to interfere in its national reunification, and will leave no room for separatist activities seeking "Taiwan independence" in any form, said the spokesperson. <br/><br/>China's reunification is a historical trend and the right path, while "Taiwan independence" goes against the tide of history, and it is a path to nowhere, said the spokesperson. <br/><br/>The names of diehard separatists announced today are only a part of the list, said the spokesperson. <br/><br/>"We seriously warn diehard 'Taiwan independence' separatists to avoid going down the wrong path further. Anyone who deliberately challenges the law will face severe punishment," said the spokesperson. "No one should underestimate our resolve, will and ability to defend China's sovereignty and territorial integrity." <br/><br/>We expect Taiwan compatriots to become fully aware of a few "Taiwan independence" separatists' nature of harming Taiwan, and to grasp where their own interests and well-being hinge. We hope compatriots in Taiwan will consciously make a clean break with "Taiwan independence" separatists, resolutely resist and oppose actions advocating "Taiwan independence," and join hands with compatriots on the mainland in advancing the peaceful development of cross-strait relations and the process toward national reunification, said the spokesperson. </p>

<h1 class="print"> China's political party system thrives over past decade: official </h1>
<hr>
<a class="no-print" href=" https://news.cgtn.com/news/2022-08-16/Progress-of-China-s-multiparty-cooperation-political-consultation--1cxFP5VjnJC/index.html "> 原文链接 </a> 


<p>China's system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation led by the Communist Party of China (CPC) has grown with the times, demonstrating distinctive strengths, a senior official said on Tuesday.</p> 

<p>The system, a new model of political party system formed in China, has become all the more clear in terms of the top-level design, said Chen Xu, deputy head of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, at a press conference taking stock of the changes and accomplishments of the system over the past decade.</p> 

<p>Adhering to and improving the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC have been made part of the basic strategy of the Party, according to the official.</p> 

<p>The framework of the system has been increasingly more sound and extensive with new regulations and policies adopted over the past decade, while the political consensus of the system has become increasingly firm and the system has played a more efficacious role in state governance, Chen said.</p> 

<p>In addition to the CPC, there are eight other political parties in China's political party system. Prominent individuals without affiliation to any of the political parties are also included in the system.</p> 

<p>Following the principles of long-term coexistence, mutual oversight, sincerity, and sharing the rough times and the smooth, the parties have jointly created a multiparty cooperation system in which the CPC exercises state power and the other parties participate fully in the administration of state affairs under the leadership of the CPC.</p> 

<p>According to Chen, 29 non-CPC figures were serving as vice governors and in other corresponding positions in 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities across the country as of June 2021, and another 380 were members of leadership bodies of prefecture-level governments.</p> 

<p>Non-CPC parties and prominent individuals without party affiliations have played positive roles in state governance. They have taken an active part in the country's carbon emissions peaking and neutrality drive, poverty reduction efforts, and environmental protection along the Yangtze River.</p> 

<p>The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) serves as a key mechanism for multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC.</p> 

<p>Over the past decade, the National Committee of the CPPCC received more than 58,000 proposals and filed more than 47,000 pieces. A great number of them have made it into policies and measures of the country, said Zhang Jing'an, a senior official with the committee, at the same press conference.</p> 

<p>"A new model grown out of the soil of China, China's political party system has shown strengths in multiple aspects," said Chen.</p> 

<p>Zou Jiayi, deputy secretary-general of the CPPCC National Committee, said the CPPCC has made great efforts in building broad consensus and strengthening the great unity of all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation at home and abroad.</p> 

<p>China's political party system is able to extensively and unfailingly represent the fundamental interests of all ethnic groups and social sectors, thus avoiding the defects of the old-fashioned party systems which represent only a selective few or the vested interests.</p> 

<p>It unites all political parties and non-affiliates towards a common goal, which is the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation at present, thus mitigating the risks of inadequate oversight in one-party rule, and the problems of power rotation and destructive competition among multiple political parties.</p>
