<p>A signed article by Chinese President Xi Jinping titled "Build on the Past to Make Greater Strides in China-Kazakhstan Relations" was published Tuesday in the <i>Kazakhstanskaya</i> <i>Pravda</i> newspaper ahead of his state visit to Kazakhstan.<br/><br/>The following is an English version of the full text of the article:<br/><br/>Build on the Past to Make Greater Strides in China-Kazakhstan Relations <br/><br/>Xi Jinping <br/><br/>President of the People's Republic of China <br/><br/>In the charming season of autumn, I will be making a state visit to the friendly country of Kazakhstan at the invitation of President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. After an interval of five years, it will be my fourth visit to the beautiful country known for its vast steppe, majestic landscape and hospitable people. I very much look forward to the visit.<br/><br/>Bound together by mountains and rivers and common interests, China and Kazakhstan are good neighbors, good friends and good partners. For thousands of years, the two peoples have had amicable ties, jointly writing an epic of East-West interactions along the ancient Silk Road. Huen Tsang, an eminent Tang-dynasty monk (602-664), and Chen Cheng, a Ming-dynasty envoy (1365-1457), both set foot on Kazakhstan. Al-Farabi the "Eastern Aristotle," Abai Kunanbayev the "sage poet," and other towering cultural figures of Kazakhstan enjoy widespread fame in China. To this day, their stories are still being told among the two peoples. <br/><br/>This year marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Kazakhstan. Over the past three decades, we have braved wind and rain, with our hands always held firmly together. Our interactions and cooperation have become ever more vibrant, and we have traveled an extraordinary path side by side. <br/><br/>—Over the past 30 years, China-Kazakhstan relations have made big strides. We have continuously advanced our relationship from good neighbors to strategic partners and to permanent comprehensive strategic partners. This incomparable characterization of our ties has enabled us to develop a new type of state-to-state relations featuring mutual respect, good-neighborly friendship, solidarity in trying times, and win-win cooperation. We always give each other unwavering support on the core issues bearing on our respective sovereignty, security and territorial integrity. We always respect each other's choice of development path based on national conditions. And we always take pleasure in each other's sustainable progress in development and national rejuvenation. We are friends to trust and partners to count on for each other, and our peoples always stand shoulder to shoulder. <br/><br/>—Over the past 30 years, China-Kazakhstan cooperation has yielded remarkable results. In recent years, China has been solidly one of Kazakhstan's leading partners for trade and investment. Despite the impact of COVID-19, we were able to again bring our bilateral trade above the $25-billion mark last year, jointly contributing to global economic recovery. China and Kazakhstan are pioneers in production capacity and investment cooperation; our cooperation list includes 52 projects worth a total of more than $21.2 billion. We have completed a number of major strategic projects, such as the 100-MW Zhanatas wind farm, the JAC automobile factory, and Shymkent Oil Refinery modernization. They have been a strong driving force for economic and social progress in Kazakhstan, and have delivered tangible benefits to our two peoples. <br/><br/>—Over the past 30 years, China and Kazakhstan have built extensive infrastructure links. We have put in place a multidimensional transportation network composed of road, railway, aviation, and oil and gas pipelines. And we are resolved to build a Eurasian land-sea multimodal "transportation artery" to offer convenient and efficient services. At all of our five road crossings and two rail crossings, normal cargo flows have resumed. And we are in close communication to open another rail crossing. At the China-Kazakhstan International Logistics Base in the eastern Chinese port of Lianyungang, products from Kazakhstan set sail for the Pacific Ocean. The China-Europe freight trains are running through Kazakhstan via more routes, making an important contribution to the stability of global industrial and supply chains. <br/><br/>—Over the past 30 years, China-Kazakhstan friendship has taken deep roots among our peoples. In Kazakhstan, there are five Confucius Institutes; in China, four universities have opened institutes on Kazakhstan studies and two have added the Kazakh language as a major. The heart-warming story of Xian Xinghai and Bakhtzhan Baikadamov, two great composers in our respective countries, has been adapted to a movie. Dr Saulebek Kabilbekov of Kazakhstan has been working for 24 years in the Daqing Ophthalmology Hospital of Heilongjiang Province, treating nearly 200,000 Chinese patients. China and Kazakhstan will soon establish cultural centers in each other's countries, and Kazakhstan will host a center for traditional Chinese medicine and a Luban Workshop. Our cultural and people-to-people exchanges will make greater strides, and the friendship between our peoples will continue to thrive on an increasingly solid foundation. <br/><br/>Having stood the test of the changing circumstances and the passage of time, China-Kazakhstan relations have long become rock-solid. We should cherish this hard-won achievement, and work harder to carry on the cause of friendship between our two countries. During my upcoming visit, I will have in-depth discussions with President Tokayev on how to further the China-Kazakhstan permanent comprehensive strategic partnership and advance our mutually beneficial cooperation across the board. We will set out plans for working together to promote China-Kazakhstan relations with the objective and vision of building a China-Kazakhstan community with a shared future. <br/><br/>First, we need to carry forward our good-neighborly friendship. Deep political mutual trust is the bedrock of the steady and sustainable development of China-Kazakhstan relations. China is willing to work with Kazakhstan to make top-level designs for the relationship from a strategic and long-term perspective, maintain close high-level interactions, and enhance exchanges and cooperation between our governments, legislatures, political parties and localities at various levels. We should make good use of the regular Prime Ministers' Meetings and the China-Kazakhstan Cooperation Committee and its sub-committees, continue to give each other firm support on issues concerning our respective core interests and major concerns, and make continuous efforts to cement the political foundation of China-Kazakhstan relations. <br/><br/>Second, we need to further deepen mutually beneficial cooperation. Next year will be the 10th anniversary of the Silk Road Economic Belt initiative that I first proposed during my visit to Kazakhstan in 2013. From laying the groundwork to building pillars and frameworks, to delivering results on the ground, and to achieving sustainable progress, the Belt and Road Initiative has become a platform for international cooperation that is open, inclusive, mutually beneficial and promotes win-win cooperation and a global public good widely welcomed by the international community. </p> 

<p>Setting our sight beyond the pandemic, China would like to partner with Kazakhstan to remain pioneers in the Belt and Road cooperation. We should improve investment and trade facilitation, fully unleash the potential of border ports and cross-border transportation, and cultivate new sources of growth such as artificial intelligence, big data, digital finance, e-commerce and green energy. We should commit ourselves to a series of new quality projects that are high-standard, sustainable, and beneficial to the people, bring bilateral cooperation to a higher level, and put the Global Development Initiative into action, so as to contribute our shares to world economic recovery. <br/><br/>Third, we need to firmly safeguard common security. In the face of complex regional and international landscapes, only by embracing unity and cooperation can we overcome difficulties of our times and resolve challenges in security governance. China would like to deepen law enforcement, security and defense cooperation with Kazakhstan. </p> 

<p>Guided by the Global Security Initiative, we should act on the concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and work together to promote the implementation of the Data Security Cooperation Initiative of China+Central Asia. We should join hands to combat terrorism, separatism, extremism, drug trafficking and transnational organized crimes, and ensure the security of oil and gas pipelines and other large cooperation projects and their personnel. We should resolutely oppose interference by external forces and work together for lasting peace and long-term stability of our region. <br/><br/>Fourth, we need to strengthen international coordination in all respects. We should enhance coordination within multilateral frameworks such as the UN, the SCO, CICA, and China+Central Asia. We should exchange views timely on international governance, food security, energy security, industrial and supply chains stability, and regional hotspots. We should reject unilateralism and bloc confrontation, and jointly safeguard an international order that is more just and more equitable. <br/><br/>The Communist Party of China (CPC) will convene its 20th National Congress soon. It will be a gathering of great significance at an important moment as the CPC embarks on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in all respects and marching toward the second centenary goal. </p> 

<p>We are glad to see that the construction of a New Kazakhstan has been fully launched, and that Kazakhstan is making strides toward the goal of becoming one of the world's top 30 most developed states. China stands ready to continue to share development achievements with Kazakhstan and learn from each other's development experience. China's door of opening-up and friendly cooperation will always be open to Kazakhstan. <br/><br/>As a Kazakh proverb goes, "Friendship is an inexhaustible wealth." China believes that as long as we keep to the principle of good-neighborly friendship and deepen all-round win-win cooperation, we will surely usher in a more splendid 30 years in China-Kazakhstan relations.</p>

<a class="no-print" href=" https://news.cgtn.com/news/2022-09-13/Xi-publishes-signed-article-in-Uzbek-media-ahead-of-state-visit--1diCt3RbHeo/index.html "> 原文链接 </a> 


<p>A signed article by Chinese President Xi Jinping titled "Working Together for a Brighter Future of China-Uzbekistan Relations" was published Tuesday in Uzbek media ahead of his state visit to the Central Asian country. <br/><br/>An English version of the article, carried by leading Uzbek newspaper Narodnoe Slovo and Uzbekistan National News Agency (UzA), is as follows: <br/><br/>Working Together for a Brighter Future of China-Uzbekistan Relations <br/><br/>Xi Jinping <br/><br/>President of the People's Republic of China <br/><br/>"The land is fertile and crops thriving. Trees flourish, and flowers and fruits abound. A place home to steeds." This is how Huen Tsang, an eminent Chinese monk in the Tang Dynasty over 1,300 years ago, depicted the richly-endowed Samarkand. In this lovely mid-autumn month, a season of harvest, I will once again visit the beautiful city of Samarkand at the invitation of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, to discuss with him plans for closer cooperation between China and Uzbekistan, and to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit. <br/><br/>Both China and Uzbekistan are ancient civilizations, and the great Silk Road has borne witness to the friendly exchanges of the two peoples over the past 2,000 years and more. Several historical figures from China traveled west to visit Uzbekistan, including Zhang Qian of the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD), Huen Tsang of the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and Chen Cheng of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), leaving their footprints in famous cities like Tashkent, Samarkand and Navoi. During the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), Sayyid Ajall Shams al-Din, a statesman whose ancestral home was in Bukhara, served as the governor of Yunnan province in China. In the mid-14th century, Wu Ru, an authority on astronomy and calendar and a native of Samarkand, participated in the construction of an observatory in Nanjing. These people were trailblazers and pioneers in the China-Uzbekistan friendship, and stories about them are still widely told in both countries. <br/><br/>Uzbekistan is a major country at the geopolitical center of Central Asia. Over the last 31 years since gaining independence, Uzbekistan has scored remarkable achievements in national development and rejuvenation. In recent years in particular, under the leadership of President Mirziyoyev, the people of Uzbekistan have embarked on a new journey toward a "New Uzbekistan". Reform and development in various areas have entered the fast lane. The country has taken on a new look, its people enjoy a better life, and its international standing has risen significantly. As a friendly neighbor and comprehensive strategic partner, China feels truly happy for Uzbekistan. <br/><br/>This year marks the 30th anniversary of China-Uzbekistan diplomatic ties. Over the past three decades, the giant tree of our relationship has taken deeper roots and grown more exuberant. The two countries have respected each other, fostered good-neighborliness, strengthened solidarity and pursued mutual benefit. Cooperation across the board has yielded concrete results. <br/><br/>—We are good friends sharing close affinity. Since 2016, President Mirziyoyev and I have stayed in close contact and forged a good working relationship and deep personal friendship through meetings, phone calls and correspondence. Under a comprehensive strategic partnership, the two countries have rendered mutual support on issues concerning each other's core interests, supported each other's implementation of development strategies, drawn upon each other's experience of reform and opening-up, and injected positive energy into regional development.<br/><br/>—We are good partners pursuing common development. China is the biggest trading partner and a major investor for Uzbekistan. Two-way trade exceeded US$8 billion in 2021, approached US$5 billion in the first half of this year, and is on course to reach the US$10-billion goal set for 2022. Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative has been fruitful, and major projects are making steady progress. All four lines of the China-Central Asia natural gas pipeline run through Uzbekistan. The tunnel on the Angren-Pap railway line, the longest tunnel in Central Asia, has been successfully completed. More transport potential is being unleashed from the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan highway and the China-Kazakhstan-Uzbekistan railway. And preparations for the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project are well under way. Uzbekistan is thus transforming from a land-locked to a land-linked country. The two sides have also carried out robust cooperation in new energy, agriculture, finance and modern telecommunications, delivering greater benefits to the two peoples. <br/><br/>—We are a good example of dialogue between civilizations. The two sides have held a wide range of exchanges including art festivals, culture promotion events, exhibitions and seminars. Cooperation is flourishing with regard to sending students, translating publications, making films, translating TV series, and conducting sub-national interactions and personnel training, which has effectively brought the two peoples still closer. In recent years, China has trained for Uzbekistan over 6,500 professionals of various fields. They are taking an active part in Uzbekistan's reform and development endeavors. Confucius Institutes have been set up in Tashkent and Samarkand where a great number of Uzbeks learned the Chinese language and they have become envoys of friendship between our two countries. Cooperation in tourism is taking off, bringing more Chinese to the beautiful land of Uzbekistan. The preservation and restoration of historical sites in Khiva, a project launched during my visit to Samarkand in 2013, has been successfully concluded, further augmenting the charm of this ancient city. <br/><br/>—We are good brothers supporting each other in times of need. China and Uzbekistan, with their interests closely entwined, have stood together through thick and thin. We have maintained close coordination both bilaterally and in such regional and multilateral frameworks as the SCO. We have worked together to oppose external interference, combat the three forces of terrorism, separatism and extremism, and tackle transnational organized crimes and drug trafficking. By strengthening intelligence sharing and expanding personnel training, we have jointly forged a strong shield of security. In face of the COVID-19 pandemic, our two countries have supported each other and conducted active cooperation. Chinese vaccines, which can now be jointly produced with Uzbekistan, have played a major role in Uzbekistan's fight against the virus, and a Chinese COVID drug has been approved for clinical use in Uzbekistan, providing effective protection for the life of people in both countries. <br/><br/>Over 2,000 years of friendly exchanges and three decades of mutually beneficial cooperation show that enhancing China-Uzbekistan cooperation on all fronts conforms to the trend of history and meets the fundamental interests of both peoples. Standing at the intersection of past and future, we are full of confidence and expectation for a more promising prospect of China-Uzbekistan relations. <br/><br/>First, we need to enhance mutual support and strengthen the bond of mutual trust. We need to set out the blueprint for China-Uzbekistan relations in the new era from a strategic and long-term perspective. We need to intensify high-level exchanges, increase mutual political trust, deepen the sharing of governance experience, and continue to render mutual support on issues concerning each other's core interests. China firmly supports Uzbekistan in pursuing a development path suited to its own national conditions and opposes interference in Uzbekistan's internal affairs by any force. <br/><br/>Second, we need to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation to pursue common development and prosperity. We should forge a better synergy between our development strategies and jointly explore new pathways to bilateral cooperation in economy, trade, investment, key projects and other fields. China has entered a new development stage and is making active efforts to foster a new development paradigm. Uzbekistan is welcome to board the express train of China's development and share its development opportunities. Next year marks the tenth anniversary of the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative. Our two sides could use this opportunity and harness the momentum to further flesh out the bilateral cooperation and pursue high-quality development together. We also need to expand cooperation on poverty reduction and alleviation so that more people in both countries benefit from our mutually beneficial cooperation. <br/><br/>China hopes to work with Uzbekistan to actively implement the Global Development Initiative, and take concerted actions to safeguard the interests of developing countries and foster a balanced, coordinated and inclusive development landscape that embraces win-win cooperation, works for all and delivers common prosperity. <br/><br/>Third, we need to strengthen security cooperation to defuse risks and challenges. Our two sides need to deepen cooperation in the security field and unequivocally reject attempts by any force to undermine regional security, to foster a secure external environment for the development of both countries. Afghanistan is a mutual neighbor of China and Uzbekistan. A peaceful, stable, growing and prosperous Afghanistan is in our shared interests. China appreciates and supports the unique role of Uzbekistan in resolving the issue of Afghanistan. We stand ready to work with Uzbekistan to put the Global Security Initiative into action, fend off new threats and challenges, and uphold peace, stability and international fairness and justice. <br/><br/>Fourth, we need to promote cultural exchanges to enhance people-to-people connectivity. Between relatives and friends alike, with closer interaction the affinity grows. The China-Uzbekistan friendship enjoys a time-honored history and our cooperation on people-to-people exchanges has a solid foundation and bright prospects. We need to expand cooperation in the areas of media, education, health, culture, tourism, press, archeology and at the sub-national level, open culture centers in each other's countries at an earlier time and set up a Luban Workshop in Uzbekistan, to foster a multi-faceted framework of people-to-people exchanges. This will help sustain the growth of China-Uzbekistan relations and build a lasting friendship between our peoples. <br/><br/>During my visit to Uzbekistan this time, I will attend the SCO Samarkand Summit. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty on Long-Term Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation of the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Guided by the purposes and principles enshrined in these two documents, the SCO has acted on the Shanghai Spirit, stayed true to its founding mission, and promoted the joint efforts among its member states for stability and development. The SCO has set a fine example of a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation, and proved itself an important and constructive force in the Eurasian region and in international affairs. <br/><br/>Since assuming SCO presidency, despite the impacts from COVID-19, Uzbekistan has strengthened communication and coordination with other member states, made solid efforts on various fronts, and preserved the SCO's momentum of sound and steady development. China applauds Uzbekistan for its efforts. I am confident that with the joint efforts of all sides, the Samarkand Summit will produce fruitful outcomes and make greater contribution to building an even closer SCO community with a shared future and to peace, stability, development and prosperity of our region. <br/><br/>As the saying goes, when your heart knows its direction, the distance to destination will never be long. Bearing in mind the original aspiration upon the establishment of our diplomatic relations, China will work with Uzbekistan to seize the historical opportunities, forge ahead side by side on the path of national development and rejuvenation, and make joint efforts toward the goal of building a China-Uzbekistan community with a shared future.</p>

<p>　　从人脸识别的逐步应用，到方兴未艾的自动驾驶，人工智能正在越来越多领域发挥作用。科技部、教育部、工信部等6部门联合发布《关于加快场景创新以人工智能高水平应用促进经济高质量发展的指导意见》，统筹人工智能场景创新；科技部发布《关于支持建设新一代人工智能示范应用场景的通知》，支持建设包括智慧农场、智能港口在内的10个人工智能示范应用场景……近段时间，助力培育人工智能应用场景的政策措施接连出台，为牵引推动人工智能落地营造了良好的政策环境。</p>
<p>　　习近平总书记强调：“人工智能是引领这一轮科技革命和产业变革的战略性技术，具有溢出带动性很强的‘头雁’效应。”作为赋能手段，人工智能与实体经济融合，能够引领产业转型，孕育新产业新模式新业态；作为服务人们美好生活的工具，人工智能的应用有助于提升生活品质，满足人们消费升级需求。无论是促进传统产业提质增效，还是培育新的经济增长点，人们对以互联网、大数据、人工智能为代表的新一代信息技术寄予厚望。</p>
<p>　　应用需求是技术进步的重要推动力。为推动人工智能应用落地，2017年国务院印发《新一代人工智能发展规划》，截至2021年12月，国家新一代人工智能创新发展试验区已达17个。据测算，我国人工智能核心产业规模超过4000亿元，企业数量超过3000家。得益于海量数据处理带来的旺盛需求，丰富应用场景提供的试验土壤，我国在计算机视觉、语音识别等领域走在世界前列。在应用实践中锤炼、迭代和改进的技术，反过来又促进应用更加深化，从而形成技术进步与应用推广相互推进的良性循环。这是我国发展新技术的重要优势，过去人工智能产业发展受益于此，推动人工智能应用迈向更高水平，依然需要用好这一长处。</p>
<p>　　随着我国数字基础设施建设提速，更多潜在应用场景将会不断涌现。智能制造、智慧城市、智能矿山、智能供应链等，为拓展人工智能应用提供了广阔的舞台。就此而言，应当加快拓展应用场景，进行规模化市场探索，打造形成一批可复制、可推广的标杆型示范应用场景。加速新技术落地，有助于保持我国人工智能发展的优势。挖掘更多应用场景，着力打通落地环节，推动人工智能与相关行业深度融合，人工智能应用必将发挥更大效用。</p>
<p>　　需要注意的是，发展人工智能产业是一项系统工程。比如，支撑自动驾驶升级，除了“聪明”的车，更要有“智慧”的路，这离不开营造包括技术研发、基础设施、数据流通在内的良好产业生态。此外，发挥应用场景的优势，也需及时补上底层技术的短板。推进人工智能应用走深走实的同时，加强软硬件、底层技术攻关，两者齐头并进，才能增强产业发展后劲，掌握发展的主动权。</p>
<p>　　犹记北京冬奥会开幕式上，小朋友在舞台上自由跑动，脚下踩出一片片“雪花”。它们时而散开，时而汇聚，星光也跟着孩子们的脚步流动，这是“人工智能实时视频特效”带来的神奇效果。未来几年是人工智能技术跃迁的重要窗口期，随着应用场景资源的持续开放，场景创新能力的不断提升，人工智能与产业的融合必将更加紧密，人工智能的应用也必将迈向更高水平，为促进经济社会高质量发展注入源源不断的智慧动能。</p>

<p>　　我种了一辈子的粮食。1971年高中毕业那会儿，农村真是很穷，农业耕种方式落后，农民种地都是靠肩挑背扛。我当时放弃了做一名小学老师的机会，下定决心在农村做一个种粮农民，多种粮、种好粮。如今，我的儿子、孙子都和我一样，成了职业农民。</p>
<p>　　提高粮食产量，首先要有良种。我们与省市农科院开展合作，不断改良作物品种，推动粮食丰收。2010年，我牵头成立了淙祥现代农业种植专业合作社，成为种粮大户。2012年，安徽省农科院挂牌了千亩种业基地，我们开始承担重大农业科技项目和优良品种试验示范，审定的新品种在全省乃至黄淮地区推广。</p>
<p>　　近年来，在农业生产上，我们取得了32项新技术新成果。与此同时，我们将自己总结的小麦、玉米、大豆栽培技术汇编成册，用农民听得懂的表达方式进行推广，取得了一定成效。“小麦生产变化大，苗期掌握三耳朵”“驴耳苗，半耷拉，壮苗生长葱绿色”“拔节追肥不宜早，免得倒伏减产多”……60条谚语栽培法，受到乡亲们的欢迎。这是对我科学种粮的理解和肯定。</p>
<p>　　今年，我们的小麦单产、总产、品质大幅度提高。“阜航麦1号”平均亩产811.29公斤，“皖垦麦22”平均亩产818.52公斤，获得了历史性的丰产丰收。我给习近平总书记写了一封信，汇报了十多年来从事粮食生产、帮助群众脱贫等情况和体会，表达了继续做好农业研发推广工作，带动更多农民多种粮、种好粮的决心。高兴的是，没过多久我就收到了习近平总书记的回信。乡亲们听说后，都涌到我家里，一起感受这份温暖和关怀。在字里行间，我深深体会到了习近平总书记对咱们农民的深厚情感。这不仅是对我本人，也是对全国农民的巨大鼓舞。</p>
<p>　　随着农业科技的发展，现在的种粮人可以不用像过去那样劳累了。比如我们创办的农业合作社，成立了农机专业服务队、植保队，实现了全过程机械化生产，收小麦，1000亩地三台机子两天就可以收完。接下来，我们祖孙三代将继续钻研农业科学技术，积极配合农技部门研制更多更好的农业新品种、新技术。在农业生产经营方面，努力通过托管、结对合作等方式，争取流转更多的耕地；通过发展农产品品牌，创新农业社会化服务，不断扩大服务范围、提高服务水平。种粮农民有钱挣、得实惠，日子越过越好，相信会有更多年轻人考虑从事现代农业。</p>
<p>　　做农民，干农业，种粮食，大有前景。我们家祖孙三代都种粮，这对于我来说就是一份光荣。习近平总书记在回信中强调：“希望种粮大户发挥规模经营优势，积极应用现代农业科技”。我一定会继续努力，带动广大小农户多种粮、种好粮，一起为国家粮食安全贡献力量。</p>
