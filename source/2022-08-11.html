<h1 class="print"> China releases white paper on Taiwan question and reunification of China in new era </h1>
<hr>
<a class="no-print" href=" https://news.cgtn.com/news/2022-08-10/China-s-State-Council-releases-white-paper-on-Taiwan-question-1cnrckH6fSM/index.html "> 原文链接 </a> 


<p>China published a white paper titled "The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification in the New Era" on Wednesday, elaborating the fact that Taiwan is part of China and stressing that realizing China's complete reunification is a shared aspiration of the Chinese nation.</p> 

<p>The white paper was released amid high tension across the Taiwan Straits. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently made <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2022-08-03/Pelosi-ignores-Taiwan-visit-warnings-China-to-take-countermeasures-1cb90Qh5wQ0/index.html">a provocative visit</a> to China's Taiwan region in disregard of China's strong opposition and serious representations.</p> 

<p>The white paper begins by reaffirming that "Taiwan is part of China" as an "indisputable fact."</p> 

<p>Taiwan has belonged to China since ancient times. This statement has a sound basis in history and jurisprudence, according to the white paper. </p> 

<p>The UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 is a political document encapsulating the one-China principle whose legal authority leaves no room for doubt and is acknowledged worldwide, says the white paper. </p> 

<p>It says the one-China principle represents the universal consensus of the international community; it is consistent with the basic norms of international relations.</p> 

<p>The white paper also gives a comprehensive summary of the CPC's resolute efforts, major achievements and precious experience in promoting China's complete reunification.</p> 

<p>It also gives a systematic elaboration on the CPC and the Chinese government's principles and policies in advancing national reunification in the new era and portrayed the bright prospects after the peaceful reunification is achieved under "One Country, Two Systems." </p> 

<p>Noting that national reunification is an essential step toward national rejuvenation, the white paper highlights that the future of Taiwan lies in China's reunification, and the well-being of the people in Taiwan hinges on the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.</p> 

<p>National reunification by peaceful means is the first choice of the CPC and the Chinese government in resolving the Taiwan question, as it best serves the interests of the Chinese nation as a whole, including the compatriots in Taiwan, and it works best for the long-term stability and development of China, says the white paper.</p>

<p>About 78.34 percent of respondents from 22 countries believe the Chinese economy has injected vitality into the global economy over the past decade and has become the engine of the world economy, according to a joint survey conducted by CGTN Think Tank and the Chinese Institute of Public Opinion at Renmin University of China. </p>

<p>Over half of the respondents have higher education, with 54.71 percent having a bachelor's degree or above, of which 15.22 percent are masters and doctors. </p>

<p>There are nearly 100 million people in rural China who have been lifted out of poverty in the past decade, and the vast majority of global respondents believed the top two reasons for the historic achievement in poverty alleviation are that China's economy maintains rapid growth and that Chinese leaders are determined and firmly marching toward their goals. </p>

In Africa, 73.87 percent of respondents were most impressed by China's 5G, and 55.28 percent praised the country's high-speed railway. In Europe, 52.77 percent of respondents were impressed with the country's progress in artificial intelligence. </p>
