<h1 class="print"> U.S. focus is on Afghan evacuations, says Harris amid troop withdrawal criticism </h1>

<p>U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said on Monday that the United States is focusing on evacuation efforts in Afghanistan, and there would be plenty of time to analyze the troop withdrawal.</p> 

<p>Harris made the remark during her visit to Singapore. She met with Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and President Halimah Yacob during a trip to Southeast Asia, including Vietnam.</p> 

<p>"There is going to be plenty of time to analyze what has happened and what has taken place in the context of the withdrawal from Afghanistan," Harris said during a joint news conference with Singapore's prime minister.</p> 

<p>"But right now, we are singularly focused on evacuating American citizens, Afghans who have worked with us and Afghans who are vulnerable, including women and children, and that is our singular focus at this time," said Harris.</p> 

<p>"We hope Afghanistan does not become an epicenter for terrorism again," said Lee, adding that Singapore had offered transport aircraft to help with evacuations. <br/><br/><strong>Read more: </strong><br/><br/><a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-08-22/Two-thirds-of-Americans-say-Afghanistan-war-was-not-worth-fighting-12VAEAcIIPm/index.html">Two-thirds of Americans say Afghanistan war was not worth fighting</a><br/><br/><a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-08-23/Kamala-Harris-can-t-rescue-U-S-credibility-in-Southeast-Asia-12XG9G4vutW/index.html">Kamala Harris can't rescue U.S.' credibility in Southeast Asia</a></p> 

<p>The United States and Singapore reached security agreements on Monday that reaffirm America's presence in the region through "rotational deployments of U.S. P-8 aircraft and littoral combat ships to Singapore," according to a fact sheet of the meeting shared by the White House. <br/><br/>The two countries also agreed to expand cybersecurity cooperation in the financial sector, the military and enhance information exchange on cyber threats, according to details shared by the White House.</p> 

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden has been facing criticism at home and abroad over his handling of the withdrawal of U.S. forces and the chaotic evacuation after the lightning takeover by the Taliban.</p> 

<p>Conflicts between Taliban fighters and Western-backed government forces escalated after U.S.-led foreign troops began the final stage of their withdrawal from Afghanistan in May. As the Taliban took control of Kabul on August 15, the U.S. and some other countries intensified efforts to evacuate their diplomats and other nationals as well as Afghans who want to leave the country.</p> 

<p>The Biden administration indicated that it may stay in Kabul beyond its self-imposed August 31 deadline in order to complete its evacuation efforts. But the Taliban said on Monday that August 31 is a "red line" for pulling out U.S. troops.</p> 

<p>"This is something you can say – it's a red line," Taliban's spokesman Suhail Shaheen told Sky News. "President Biden announced this agreement that until August 31, they would withdraw all their military forces. So if they extended, that means they are extending occupation."</p> 

<p>Shaheen warned that an extension of the withdrawal deadline would create mistrust between the Taliban and Washington.</p> 

<p>"If they are intent on continuing the occupation, so it will provoke a reaction," he said.</p> 

<p>China has repeatedly called for a responsible and orderly withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Monday said the U.S. is the "major cause" and the "biggest external factor" in the Afghan issue. <br/><br/>"It cannot simply walk away," Wang said at a regular press briefing. "The United States has pledged multiple times it would help Afghanistan maintain stability, prevent chaos and help with its peace and reconstruction." <br/><br/>"We hope the United States matches its words with its actions, taking up its responsibilities on the Afghan issue, and honoring its commitments over Afghanistan's development, reconstruction and humanitarian aid," Wang added. <br/><br/>Commenting on the U.S. vice president's visit to Singapore and Vietnam, he stressed that exchanges between countries should be conducive to enhancing mutual trust and maintaining regional and global peace and stability. <br/><br/>(With input from Reuters)</p>
