<p>China on Thursday announced a landmark victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, known as a "Xiaokang" society in Chinese, as the Communist Party of China (CPC) celebrates its centenary. <br/><br/>"We have realized the first centenary goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects," Chinese President Xi Jinping said at a <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-07-01/Grand-gathering-to-celebrate-CPC-centenary-starts--11x6RAJPY4w/index.html">grand gathering</a> at Tian'anmen Square in Beijing. <br/><br/>Xi, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, vowed that the CPC will lead the Chinese people to strive for better lives and national rejuvenation. <br/><br/>Founded in July 1921 with just over 50 members, the CPC has grown into the world's largest political party with <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-06-30/CPC-membership-grows-to-over-95-million-11vF0GvladG/index.html">more than 95 million members</a>.  <br/><br/>The Party had set two centenary goals: The first was to build a moderately prosperous society in all respects by 2021 when the CPC celebrates its centenary, and the second is to build China into a great modern socialist country in all respects by the middle of the century to celebrate the centenary of the People's Republic of China (PRC).</p>

<p>Xi reviewed the historical background of the CPC's creation and explained the role it played in the nation's efforts to realize rejuvenation. <br/><br/>After the Opium War in the 1840s, China gradually became a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society and endured intense humiliation and the people suffered great pain, Xi noted. "Since that time, national rejuvenation has been the greatest dream of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation." <br/><br/>After a series of attempts to "save the nation" failed, the CPC was created when the country urgently needed new ideas and a new organization to lead the movement, he said. <br/><br/>"Since the very day of its founding, the Party has made seeking happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation its aspiration and mission," he said. <br/><br/>Xi summarized the Party's efforts and successes in leading a series of revolutions and the country's modernization, particularly in pursuing reform and opening-up since 1978, which he called a "crucial move in making China what it is today." <br/><br/>China, a relatively poor country decades ago, has become the world's second largest economy with its gross domestic product (GDP) exceeding 100 trillion yuan (about $15 trillion) and per capita GDP over $10,000. It declared the victory in eradicating absolute poverty nationwide by the end of 2020. <br/><br/>Highlighting the fulfillment of building a "Xiaokang" society and other achievements, Xi said the Party and the people have shown the world that "China's national rejuvenation has become a historical inevitability."</p> 

<p>Xi underscored the close relations between the CPC and the people, stressing that the Party "has always represented the fundamental interests of all Chinese people." <br/><br/>"Any attempt to divide the Party from the Chinese people or to set the people against the Party is bound to fail," he warned. <br/><br/>As China embarks on a new journey toward socialist modernization, he vowed that the CPC will continue to practice a people-centered philosophy of development, address the people's concerns and promote common prosperity for all. <br/><br/>"On the journey ahead, we must rely closely on the people to create history," he said. <br/><br/>The people-centered philosophy of development was raised by Xi at the fifth plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Committee in October 2015. The philosophy stresses that China's development must be for the people and by the people, and its fruits shared among the people. <br/><br/>The philosophy has been emphasized again in China's latest development blueprint – the Outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035. The document vows to further improve people's livelihoods by pursuing more balanced, higher-quality development.</p> 

<p>Xi also expounded on the main principles of China's foreign policy and vision on international relations. He reiterated the call for building a community with a shared future for humanity and stressed the country's commitment to peace. <br/><br/>"The Chinese nation does not carry aggressive or hegemonic traits in its genes," Xi said. "China has always worked to safeguard world peace, contribute to global development and preserve international order." <br/><br/>China will stay committed to the path of peaceful development, he said. It will "promote high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) through joint efforts and use China's new achievements in development to provide the world with new opportunities," he added. <br/><br/>Proposed by Xi in 2013, the BRI which comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, aims to build trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along and beyond the ancient Silk Road routes.  <br/><br/>A total of 140 countries and regions have signed cooperation agreements with China under the BRI over the past eight years. The aggregated trade volume between China and its BRI cooperative partners has exceeded $9.2 trillion, and Chinese companies have made direct investments totaling over $130 billion in countries along the Belt and Road.</p> 

<p>Meanwhile, Xi said China will continue to champion cooperation over confrontation and oppose hegemony and power politics.  <br/><br/>The Chinese people have a strong sense of pride and confidence and will not be intimidated by threats of force, he stressed. <br/><br/>"We have never bullied, oppressed or subjugated the people of any other country, and we never will," he said. "By the same token, we will never allow any foreign force to bully, oppress or subjugate us." <br/><br/>Xi reiterated the Party's stance on Hong Kong, Macao and the Taiwan region. "We will ensure that the central government exercises overall jurisdiction over Hong Kong and Macao, and implement legal systems and enforcement mechanisms for the two special administrative regions to safeguard national security," he said. <br/><br/>He described resolving the Taiwan question and realizing China's complete reunification as a "historic mission and an unshakable commitment" of the CPC, calling for resolute action to defeat any attempt toward "Taiwan independence."</p>

<p>
	　　一个有希望的民族不能没有英雄，一个有前途的国家不能没有先锋。一百年来，我们党矢志践行初心使命，团结带领人民开辟了伟大道路、建立了伟大功业、铸就了伟大精神、积累了宝贵经验，在中华民族发展史和人类社会进步史上写下了壮丽篇章。一百年来，一代又一代中国共产党人，为赢得民族独立和人民解放、实现国家富强和人民幸福，前仆后继、浴血奋战，艰苦奋斗、无私奉献，谱写了气吞山河的英雄壮歌。“七一勋章”获得者中，有战功赫赫的百战老兵，有把生命奉献给脱贫攻坚事业的基层干部，有集丰厚理论素养和操作技能于一身的大国工匠，有用红色基因树人铸魂的教育工作者，有潜心研究、矢志奉献的科学家，有传承爱国守边精神的农牧民……他们为党和人民作出了杰出贡献，创造了宝贵精神财富。</p>

<h1> 运用市场机制促进碳减排（人民时评） </h1>
<hr>
<div class="author"> 寇江泽 </div> 


<a href=" http://opinion.people.com.cn/n1/2021/0629/c1003-32143186.html "> 原文链接 </a> 


<p>
	　　充分发挥市场机制作用，能够有效推动碳资源配置优化，以成本效益最优的方式实现碳减排</p>
<p>
	　　</p>
<p>
	　　据悉，全国碳排放权交易市场即将启动上线交易。鉴于全国碳市场覆盖排放量超过40亿吨，我国将成为全球覆盖温室气体排放量规模最大的碳市场。</p>
<p>
	　　当前，我国碳排放总量大、强度高，能源总需求一定时期内还会持续增长，实现碳达峰、应对气候变化的任务十分艰巨。习近平总书记在中共中央政治局第二十九次集体学习时强调：“要全面实行排污许可制，推进排污权、用能权、用水权、碳排放权市场化交易，建立健全风险管控机制。”全国碳排放权交易市场是落实我国二氧化碳排放达峰目标与碳中和愿景的核心政策工具之一。建设全国碳排放权交易市场，在应对气候变化和促进绿色低碳发展中充分发挥市场机制作用，能够有效推动碳资源配置优化，以成本效益最优的方式实现碳减排，并促进技术进步、产业升级，科学实现碳达峰、碳中和目标。</p>
<p>
	　　我国高度重视利用市场机制应对气候变化。截至今年3月，碳交易试点地区碳市场覆盖钢铁、电力、水泥等20多个行业，近3000家重点排放企业，累计覆盖4.4亿吨碳排放量，累计成交金额约104.7亿元。试点范围内，企业碳排放总量和强度实现“双降”，显示出碳市场以较低成本控制碳排放的良好效果。同时，我国以发电行业为突破口率先在全国开展碳交易。今年1月1日，全国碳市场发电行业第一个履约周期正式启动，2225家发电行业重点排放单位分到碳排放配额。全国碳排放权交易市场上线运行，将扩大市场、行业、地域覆盖范围，丰富交易品种和交易方式，将成为推动绿色低碳发展的一个标志性成果。</p>
<p>
	　　全国碳排放权交易市场是一项重大的制度创新，也是一项复杂的系统工程，需要完善的法规制度、有效的管理机制、可靠的交易系统、真实的排放数据。这决定了碳市场建设不可能一蹴而就，发挥市场机制作用离不开循序渐进。统一的信息平台和准确的碳排放数据，对碳市场有效运行至关重要。碳排放数据核算、报告与核查体系等，都需要建立和完备起来。同时，从无限制排放到可交易，碳排放权要获得“价格”，前提是总量设定和配额分配。设定总量需要遵循适度从紧、循序渐进原则，充分考虑产业的承受力及竞争力。配额分配到具体企业时，要与产业发展政策导向等相一致，高耗能、高排放行业必须严格从紧。</p>
<p>
	　　实现碳达峰、碳中和是一场硬仗，也是对我们党治国理政能力的一场大考。全国碳排放权交易市场建设任重道远，必须以高度的责任感和使命感深化改革创新。在实践中，还有一系列具体问题需要解决。比如，各地政府部门、企业、技术服务机构等参与主体，能力建设要跟上；增加市场活跃度的同时，要避免过度投机和过度金融化，切实防范金融等方面风险；抵消机制政策设计，要推动山水林田湖草沙系统保护，形成市场化生态补偿机制；等等。</p>
<p>
	　　加大力度推进全国碳排放权交易市场建设，做好碳达峰、碳中和工作，有利于推动经济社会发展全面绿色转型、减缓气候变化带来的不利影响，为推动我国经济社会高质量发展、可持续发展提供新契机、注入新动力。稳扎稳打，接续奋斗，我们一定能顺利实现既定目标。</p>

<p>
	　　100多年前，27岁的李大钊以一篇《青春》，让无数青年热血沸腾。“以青春之我，创建青春之家庭，青春之国家，青春之民族，青春之人类，青春之地球，青春之宇宙……”</p>
<p>
	　　青春之我，何其美好的存在。在中国共产党百年奋斗史中，无数青年建功立业，青年英杰数不胜数。1921年中共一大召开时，毛泽东28岁，正好是13位代表的平均年龄。王继才第一次登上开山岛时26岁，嫦娥团队、神舟团队平均年龄33岁，北斗团队平均年龄35岁，国产大飞机C919的前期测试团队平均年龄30岁……</p>
<p>
	　　时间之河川流不息，迎来一代又一代新人，也见证了每代人不同的际遇和机缘。百年前的青年，面对的是救亡图存；七十多年前的青年，面对的是建设国家；四十多年前的青年，面对的是改革开放……每一代人，都要在自己所处的时代条件下为民尽责、为国尽忠。</p>
<p>
	　　但这又是一场接力赛。近代以来，无数青年苦苦探索，一代代人接力奋斗。无论其处于哪个时代、哪个地域，无论其学历如何、是贫是富，中国青年奔向的都是中华民族伟大复兴这个伟大目标。过去一个多世纪的青年如此，今天的青年亦如此。中国梦是历史的、现实的，更是未来的。</p>
<p>
	　　岁月反复诉说这样的道理――中国青年什么样，中国未来就是什么样；中国青年有多大理想，中国就有多大的梦想；中国青年下定决心前进，中国就永远不会后退。</p>
<p>
	　　中国青年前面有无数楷模，每一代青年又会成为后来人的榜样。先辈们能建立新中国，后辈们就能实现富国梦、强国梦；先辈们能在枪林弹雨中冲锋陷阵，后辈们就一定能打赢没有硝烟的战争。战争年代如此，和平年代同样如此。一次又一次，当党和国家事业需要时，当洪水泛滥、地动山摇、疫情肆虐时，“40后”“50后”站出来了，“60后”“70后”站出来了，“80后”“90后”乃至“00后”……都站出来了！</p>
<p>
	　　时代从未停止出题，中国青年从没怕过。总是这样，“青春气贯长虹，勇锐盖过怯弱，进取压倒苟安”。奋斗两个字，写在每一代中国青年的基因里。</p>
<p>
	　　习近平总书记指出，当代中国青年是与新时代同向同行、共同前进的一代，生逢盛世，肩负重任。接力棒已经交到了新时代青年手中，我们勇往直前，责无旁贷。</p>
<p>
	　　船到中流浪更急，人到半山路更陡。今天，我们比以往任何时候都更接近实现中华民族伟大复兴，但面临的困难挑战也前所未有。面对百年未有之大变局，面对几代人梦寐以求的理想彼岸，黄沙百战穿金甲，不破楼兰终不还――这是中国青年应有的英勇气概！</p>
<p>
	　　新时代为广大青年提供了人生出彩的机会，提供了梦想成真的机会，提供了同祖国和时代一起成长与进步的机会。新时代的中国青年何其幸运，背靠强大的祖国，拥有美好的生活，我们应该活出无比精彩的人生！时代昂扬向上的曲线，应该是中国青年的生命轨迹。</p>
<p>
	　　站在“两个一百年”的历史交汇点上，一代青年整装出发，努力守护好建设好伟大祖国的红色江山，创造无愧于历史和人民的崭新业绩。</p>
<p>
	　　让我们奋力奔跑，奋勇向前！</p>
