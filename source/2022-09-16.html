<p>China is ready to work with Russia to play a leading role in injecting stability into a changing world, Chinese President Xi Jinping said during a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Uzbekistan on Thursday.</p> 

<p>The two countries have maintained close coordination on the international stage to uphold basic norms of international relations, said Xi.</p> 

<p>"In the face of changes of the world, of our times and of history, China will work with Russia to fulfill their responsibilities as major countries and play a leading role in injecting stability into a world of change and disorder," he said.</p> 

<p>Putin said the world is undergoing multiple changes, yet the one thing that remains unchanged is the friendship and mutual trust between Russia and China, adding that the Russia-China comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination is as stable as mountains.</p> 

<p>Both Russia and China stand for a more equitable and reasonable international order, setting a fine example in international relations, he said.</p> 

<p>The two leaders made the remarks when exchanging views on China-Russia relations and international and regional issues of shared interest in the Uzbek city of Samarkand on the sidelines of the 22nd meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).</p> 

<p><strong>Cooperation and coordination</strong></p> 

<p>Xi said bilateral cooperation between China and Russia in various fields has moved forward steadily, with activities related to the Year of Sports Exchange well underway, and a robust momentum in sub-national cooperation and people-to-people exchange.</p> 

<p>He emphasized that China will work with Russia to extend strong mutual support on issues concerning each other's core interests, and deepen practical cooperation in trade, agriculture, connectivity and other areas.</p> 

<p>He called for both sides to strengthen coordination within the SCO, the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia, BRICS and other multilateral mechanisms to promote solidarity and mutual trust among related parties.</p> 

<p>The Chinese president also said China and Russia should expand pragmatic cooperation, safeguard the security and interests of the region, and preserve the common interests of developing countries and emerging market countries.</p> 

<p>Putin said Russia will consolidate and deepen bilateral and multilateral communication and collaboration with China and expand cooperation in key areas such as trade and energy.</p> 

<p>He added that Russia will work with China to promote continued, deeper cooperation among the SCO member states based on the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs, so as to build an authoritative platform for upholding regional security and stability.</p> 

<p><strong>One-China principle</strong></p> 

<p>During the talks, Putin said the Russian side is firmly committed to the one-China principle and condemns the provocative moves by individual countries on issues concerning China's core interests.</p> 

<p>Xi said he appreciated Russia's adherence to the one-China principle, stressing that Taiwan is part of China, the Chinese side firmly opposes the "Taiwan independence" separatist forces and external interference, and no country is entitled to act as a judge on the Taiwan question.</p>

<p>China and Uzbekistan on Thursday pledged to speed up bilateral cooperation and bring more fruitful outcomes as President Xi Jinping held talks with his Uzbek counterpart Shavkat Mirziyoyev in the Uzbek city of Samarkand.</p> 

<p>The two leaders agreed to expand mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries, consolidate the friendship and partnership and work toward a community with a shared future at the bilateral level.</p> 

<p>Xi arrived in Samarkand on Wednesday evening for a state visit to Uzbekistan and the 22nd meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).</p> 

<p>During the talks with Mirziyoyev on Thursday, Xi said China and Uzbekistan have respected each other, fostered good-neighborliness, strengthened solidarity and pursued mutual benefit over the past three decades.</p> 

<p>He also said China appreciates the contributions Uzbekistan has made toward having a successful Samarkand SCO summit and stands ready to work with it to promote the sound development of the organization.</p> 

<p>Hailing the Chinese president's state visit as "historic," Mirziyoyev said it will surely help consolidate the traditional friendship between the two countries, chart the course for future cooperation, and elevate the Uzbekistan-China comprehensive strategic partnership to a new height featuring new vitality and new prospect.</p> 

<p><strong>'Good friends, good partners, good brothers'</strong></p> 

<p>Echoing what he had said in a signed article published by Uzbek media before the trip, Xi on Thursday reiterated that China is a good friend, a good partner and a good brother to Uzbekistan.</p> 

<p>China firmly supports Uzbekistan in following a development path compatible with its national conditions, supports its efforts to uphold national independence, sovereignty, security and social stability, and opposes interference by any forces in its internal affairs, he said.</p> 

<p>China is ready to work with Uzbekistan to implement the vision of a China-Uzbekistan community with a shared future, deepen all-round cooperation for mutual benefit and jointly usher in a better future, Xi added.</p> 

<p>For his part, Mirziyoyev said China is a reliable friend and comprehensive strategic partner, and Uzbekistan-China relations fully embody the principle of mutual respect, good-neighborliness and mutual benefit.</p> 

<p>Uzbekistan will always be trustworthy and a good neighbor, good friend and good partner to China, he said.</p> 

<p>He said the country is firmly and unequivocally committed to the one-China policy and firmly supports China's position on matters concerning its core interests, including those related to China's Taiwan and Xinjiang.</p> 

<p><strong>Common development</strong></p> 

<p>Xi emphasized that China and Uzbekistan should firmly support each other on issues concerning sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and other core interests and move faster to synergize their development strategies and promote common development.</p> 

<p>The Chinese president called on the two countries to scale up cooperation in trade and investment and step up collaboration in the digital economy and green development.</p> 

<p>Uzbekistan is welcome to take an active part in the China International Import Expo to share in more of the development opportunities brought by China's massive market, Xi said.</p> 

<p>He added that China is ready to work with Uzbekistan to improve the trans-Eurasia transportation corridor and make an early start in constructing the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway.</p> 

<p>The two sides need to expand energy cooperation, jointly ensure the safe operation of the China-Central Asia natural gas pipeline and extend cooperation to new energy, with a view to fostering a new pattern of all-dimensional energy cooperation, he said.</p> 

<p>Xi said both countries need to enhance cooperation on poverty alleviation and inspire and support each other in promoting growth and improving livelihoods.</p> 

<p>Mirziyoyev said Uzbekistan will continue actively participating in the Belt and Road cooperation and advance the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project.</p> 

<p>The country will enhance cooperation with China in trade, investment, natural gas, new energy, agricultural infrastructure, culture, sub-national ties and people-to-people exchanges, he said.</p> 

<p><strong>For the region</strong></p> 

<p>Noting that China and Central Asian countries have a shared future and a deep stake in each other's security and stability, Xi said China is ready to work more closely with Uzbekistan to firmly oppose external interference in internal affairs, firmly safeguard domestic stability and firmly defend the security interests of the region.</p> 

<p>China will also work with Uzbekistan and other regional countries to strengthen the "China Plus Central Asia" meeting mechanism and open up broader space for cooperation between China and Central Asian countries, he said.</p> 

<p>Xi said China will also work with Uzbekistan to actively implement the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and Global Security Initiative (GSI), uphold the common interests of developing countries and contribute to building a more just and equitable international governance system.</p> 

<p>Mirziyoyev said Uzbekistan fully supports the GDI and the GSI and appreciates China's strong support for Uzbekistan's SCO presidency.</p> 

<p>He also expressed readiness to work more closely with China in the SCO, "China Plus Central Asia" and BRICS-plus mechanisms to uphold the Shanghai Spirit and jointly safeguard the region's security and stability.</p> 

<p>Following the talks, the two leaders signed and issued a joint declaration. The two countries also signed several documents on cooperation in agriculture, the digital economy, green development, culture, media and others.</p> 

<p>Before the talks, Mirziyoyev held a grand welcome ceremony for Xi, who also inspected the honor guard. After the talks, Mirziyoyev held a banquet for Xi, and the leaders planted an oak tree together.  A symbol of longevity, the oak tree also signifies that the China-Uzbekistan friendship will thrive and endure.</p> 

<p>This year marks the 30th anniversary of China-Uzbekistan diplomatic ties and the 10th anniversary of the establishment of a strategic partnership between the two countries.</p> 

<p>In 2016, during Xi's visit to the country, both countries agreed to promote their relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership.</p>
