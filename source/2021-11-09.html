<h1 class="print"> 'Taiwan independence' is a dead-end: Mainland spokesperson </h1>

<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Monday warned Taiwan authorities that the "Taiwan independence" is a dead-end street with regards to their recent comments on the upcoming Honduran presidential election.</p> 

<p>"There is only one China in the world and the Taiwan region is an inalienable part of China's territory," Wang said at the regular press briefing. </p> 

<p>"The one-China principle is a universally recognized norm governing international relations and the consensus of the international community"</p> 

<p>According to media reports, Honduran presidential candidate for the left-wing Liberty and Refoundation Party Xiomara Castro said on September 6 that she would open diplomatic relations with China if she wins elections in November. Some Taiwan authorities had issued a statement to warn Honduras against "flashy and false" promises by the mainland, adding that it is a usual trick to undermine ties between Taiwan and its "allies".</p> 

<p>"We are here to tell Taiwan authorities, 'Taiwan independence' is a dead end and their 'dollar diplomacy' will lead nowhere," Wang stressed. </p> 

<p>Any attempts to reverse the historical trend by soliciting foreign support is bound to fail, he added.</p>
